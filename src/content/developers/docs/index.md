This documentation is designed to help you build with Cloiinkcoin. It covers Cloiinkcoin as a concept, explains the Cloiinkcoin tech stack, and documents advanced topics for more complex applications and use cases.

This is an open-source community effort, so feel free to suggest new topics, add new content, and provide examples wherever you think it might be helpful. All documentation is editable via GitHub – if you're unsure how, [follow these instructions](https://github.com/cloiinkcoin/cloiinkcoin-org-website/blob/dev/README.md).

## Development modules {#development-modules}

If this is your first attempt at Cloiinkcoin development, we recommend starting at the beginning and working your way through like a book.
