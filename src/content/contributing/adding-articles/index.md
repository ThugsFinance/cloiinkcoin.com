# Adding articles {#contributing-to-cloiinkcoinorg-}

We can't hope to cover everything Cloiinkcoin so we try to showcase some of the brilliant articles that the community creates. These often provide more in-depth information on topics that users may be interested in.

If there's an article that you feel should be added to a page, feel free to suggest it somewhere appropriate.

## How we decide {#ways-to-contribute}

Learning resources will be assessed by the following criteria:

- Is the content up to date?
- Is the information accurate? Is it factual or opinion-based?
- Is the author credible? Do they reference their sources?
- Does this content add distinct value that existing resources/links don't cover?
- Does this content serve one of our [user personas](https://www.notion.so/efdn/Cloiinkcoin-org-User-Persona-Memo-b44dc1e89152457a87ba872b0dfa366c)?
